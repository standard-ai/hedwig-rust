/// Message consumers ingest messages from a queue service and present them to the user application
/// as a [`Stream`](futures_util::stream::Stream).
///
/// ## Message Decoding
///
/// Messages pulled from the service are assumed to have been created by some
#[cfg_attr(feature = "publish", doc = "[hedwig publisher](crate::publish::Publisher)")]
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "publish"), doc = "hedwig publisher")]
/// and therefore were validated against the included schema when publishing. It is the decoder's
/// responsibility (when provided to functions like [`consume`](Consumer::consume)) to check this
/// schema and the accompanying payload for validity.
///
/// ## Acknowledging Messages
/// Typically message services deliver messages with a particular delivery time window, during
/// which this message won't be sent to other consumers. In AWS SQS this is called the [visibility
/// timeout][AWS], and in GCP PubSub this is the [ack deadline][GCP].
///
/// If a message is successfully acknowledged within this time, it will be considered processed and
/// not delivered to other consumers (and possibly deleted depending on the service's
/// configuration). A message can conversely be negatively-acknowledged, to indicate e.g.
/// processing has failed and the message should be delivered again to some consumer. This time
/// window can also be modified for each message, to allow for longer or shorter message processing
/// than the default configured time window.
///
/// Implementations of this trait do not ack/nack/modify messages themselves, and instead present
/// this functionality to users with the [`AcknowledgeableMessage`] type. Message processors are
/// responsible for handling message acknowledgement, including extensions for processing time as
/// necessary.
// If we had async drop, sending nacks on drop would be nice. Alas, rust isn't there yet
///
/// Bear in mind that message delivery and acknowledgement are all best-effort in distributed
/// message services. An acknowledged or extended message may still be re-delivered for any number
/// of reasons, and applications should be made resilient to such events.
